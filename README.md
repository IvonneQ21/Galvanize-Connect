## Project Description
 The motivation behind Galvanize Connect was for students at Galvanize cohort #42 to keep in touch post graduation. Facebook, LinkedIn and Google are fantastic platforms to keep in touch, however, my team and I wanted to create our own space that we had control over in its design, and functionality. Furthermore, we want to extend this application for all Galvanize alums whether they graduated from Galvanize San Francisco, Denver, Austin, New York and others.


## Who This App Is For
 For any Galvanize alum.
